### Warning
_The following warnings come from some of our dependencies, however they do not affect the UI or the functionality of the product - if the issues will persist and will change into errors in the next version of React (v17), we will drop their usage and replace with other dependencies:_
```
npm WARN deprecated popper.js@1.16.1: Popper changed home, find its new releases at @popperjs/core
npm WARN deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
npm WARN deprecated mkdirp@0.5.3: Legacy versions of mkdirp are no longer supported. Please update to mkdirp 1.x. (Note that the API surface has changed to use Promises in 1.x.)
```
_The following dependencies raise warnings (of deprecation or renamed) in development mode: DateTime, ReactSwipableView. If the warnings will persist, and will become errors in React 17, we will drop their usage and replace them with other plugins._
